# App Router vs Pages Router

Next.js provides two different routers: the **App Router** and the **Pages Router**.

## App Router (Recommended)

The App Router is the modern routing system introduced in Next.js 13. It is built on React Server Components and supports features like streaming, layouts, and server actions. **This course focuses entirely on the App Router.**

## Pages Router (Legacy)

The Pages Router is the original routing system based on the `pages/` directory. While still supported, it is not recommended for new projects.

> **Note:** If you see tutorials mentioning `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`, they are for the Pages Router.
