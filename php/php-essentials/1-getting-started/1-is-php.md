# What is PHP?

PHP (recursive acronym for **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor**) is a widely-used, open-source scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

## Why Learn PHP?

PHP powers approximately **77% of all websites** with a known server-side programming language, including giants like WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia. Here's why it remains essential:

- **Server-Side Power**: PHP runs on the server, generating HTML that gets sent to the client's browser
- **Database Integration**: Seamlessly connects with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and other databases
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and most web servers
- **Vast Ecosystem**: Thousands of frameworks (Laravel, Symfony) and CMS platforms (WordPress, Drupal)
- **Active Development**: PHP 8.x brings modern features like JIT compilation, attributes, and union types

## How PHP Works

```
1. User requests a .php page
2. Web server (Apache/Nginx) sends the request to PHP interpreter
3. PHP processes the code, possibly querying a database
4. PHP generates HTML output
5. Server sends HTML back to the user's browser
```

## PHP vs Other Languages

| Feature | PHP | Node.js | Python |
|---------|-----|---------|--------|
| Learning Curve | Easy | Moderate | Easy |
| Web Focus | Native | Framework-based | Framework-based |
| Hosting | Everywhere | Specialized | Specialized |
| Package Manager | Composer | npm | pip |

PHP's tight integration with web servers and HTML makes it an excellent first server-side language to learn.
