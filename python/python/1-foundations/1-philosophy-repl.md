# The Zen of Python

Python isn't just about syntax; it's about a philosophy of readability and simplicity. Run `import this` in your REPL to see the guiding principles that have shaped Python's design for decades.

## Core Principles

The Zen of Python contains 19 aphorisms that guide Pythonic code:

- **Beautiful is better than ugly**: Write code that is pleasant to read
- **Explicit is better than implicit**: Don't rely on hidden magic
- **Simple is better than complex**: Choose straightforward solutions
- **Readability counts**: Code is read more often than it is written
- **There should be one obvious way to do it**: Consistency over cleverness

## The Modern REPL (3.13+)

Python 3.13 introduced a significantly improved interactive shell:

- **Multi-line editing**: Edit previous lines without retyping
- **Syntax highlighting**: Color-coded code for better readability
- **Better history**: Navigate through command history with ease
- **Paste mode**: Improved handling of pasted code blocks

```python
# Start the REPL by typing 'python' in your terminal
>>> import this
# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# ...
```

## Why Philosophy Matters

Understanding these principles helps you write code that other Python developers will immediately understand. It's the foundation of being "Pythonic".

## Code Examples

**The Zen of Python**

```python
import this

# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
```
